#Genes from Cluster#1: unique uploaded ids 98 -> corresponding genes 97, with 1 (1.02%) missing  -> 97 recognized by ClueGO.
 -> To improve the % of found genes, verify gene identifiers, download new available ClueGO conversion files or add/request additional files.

#Genes with functional annotations in all selected Ontologies from Cluster#1: 95 (97.94%) -> 2 (2.06%) are not functionally annotated in any selected Ontology!
 -> To improve the % of annotated genes, chose additional ontologies.
