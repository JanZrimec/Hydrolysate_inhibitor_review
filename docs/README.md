GO enrichment analysis of pairwise compared common genes resulting in a sensitive phenotype (-) in the presence of different inhibitors. (a-h) Pie chart represents the most significant (p < 0,05) GO terms in each functional group. The size of each section in the pie charts (and percentage display in the label) indicates the proportion of genes in each group compared to the total number of common genes in a pairwise comparison. The enrichment analysis was performed using the Cytoscape (v. 3.8.1) plug-inClueGO (v. 2.5.7) (Bindea et al., 2009) and the plug-in CluePedia (v1.5.7) (Bindea et al., 2013), with the ontology and annotation files used for GO enrichment analysis downloaded on 07.04.2021. Statistical significance represented as * for p < 0,05 and as ** for p < 0,01 (Bonferroni-Hochberg correction). To reduce the redundancy of the GO terms, related terms with similar associated genes were fused.
