Figure 1. To address the question of how yeast can be engineered for improved tolerance towards lignocellulosic hydrolysates, we have collected and statistically analysed the available data in literature. A meta-analysis of existing work on genetic alterations (gene deletion or overexpression) for tolerance towards individual inhibitors in lignocellulosic hydrolysates or to a hydrolysate as such was performed. UpSet plots represents the number of genes characterized in medium supplemented with different inhibitors or hydrolysates that resulted in a phenotypic change (sensitivity or tolerance towards the inhibitor), and the intersection among different sets.
